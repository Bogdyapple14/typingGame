Hello. This is a project i made as a begginer using Angular.
This app is a fast-typing game with two game modes : Type a text as fast as you can / Type as many words in 60 seconds.
What have i learned building this:
  - One of many ways to build dark / light theme
  - Arrays are vast and awesome
  - A small app can have pretty much logic behind
